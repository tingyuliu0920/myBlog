#### 🏡 What's RecordItem

It's an application for managing all things of life.

#### 👀 Why i want to develop RecordItem

I have a lot of things, and in the past, I used Excel to keep track of them. But that approach has its downsides. For example, I have to open my laptop every time I want to add something new. Plus, I want to track items that I no longer own, whether they were sold or broken. These items still matter to me, and I want to remember them. I'm the kind of person who has deep connections with the things I own.

#### ⚙️ Main features

- **Login, Register, and Profile Management**
- **Add Categories**
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Items**
- **Search Items**
- **Update Items**
  When an item is broken or sold, you can update it to a similar item with a higher spec. For example, upgrading from an iPad 9 to an iPad Mini.
- **Archive Items**
  For items that are broken or lost, but you decide not to replace,like an electric toothbrush.You can archive them to keep them in memory.
